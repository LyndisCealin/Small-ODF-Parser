# Small-ODF-Parser
A small ODF Parser for easier publishing on fanfiktion.de and animexx.de

## Background Story

I am not only a student of Computer Science. In my freetime I'm writing stories (mostly in german) and am publishing them on plattforms like fanfiktion.de and animexx.de . Both plattforms have different tags for text manipulation and so I have to adjust my texts at least 2 times per chapter to upload them.
I am writing in LibreOffice, because for creative texts I need a creative working environment. Parsing markdown or LaTeX would be much easier, but I really need fancy fonts to have fun while I am writing and I can't stand to write tags inside my texts.
So I will write a small parser which will save me some work.

## Why the hell javascript!?

Yeah... well. I want to give others with the same problem the opportunity to use this parser without the need for installing something. And in my opinion javascript is the easiest way to achieve this.

## Why only FF.de and Animexx?

Because right now I am only publishing on this plattforms, so I only need a parser for this two websites. But it can not be ruled out, that there might be some updates in the future for other plattforms.
